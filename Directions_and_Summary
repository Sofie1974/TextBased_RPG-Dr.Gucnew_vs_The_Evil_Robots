# At the Hexagon, a petty workplace squabble over a parking spot has escalated. Dr. Eaton is in town for a clean energy meeting a accidentally took Mr. Ton Drump's parking place, even though there is no assigned parking. Mr. Drump threw a KING-sized temper tantrum and swore revenge against Dr. Eaton. Now, Mr. Ton Drump has corrupted the building's helpful robots with his tantrum-fueled code! Dr. Eaton must build a network wide healing device and she needs YOUR help retrieving the items needed to build it and reprogram any evil robots you might encounter along the way!

Your Mission: Collect the 7 missing components for Dr. Gucnew's network-wide healing device: A Peer-Reviewed Fact-Checker, The Civics 101 Patch, A De-Escalation Algorithm, The Green Energy Core, The Tax-the-Rich Capacitor, A Historical Context Drive, and The Deregulation Lubricant

Your Starting Toolkit (Single Use):

A Civility Charm: Instantly restores 3 Focus during a Reprogramming Sequence.

The Executive Order: Doubles your reprogramming progress for one turn.

A Golden Parachute: Instantly escape a Reprogramming Sequence.

You will also encounter several items during your quest. Some of these items will help, some not so much - but you may only use these items one time per quest. Beware, Mr. Ton Drump's evil corrupted robots lurk around every corner so use your items wisely!

Once you obtain all 7 missing items, find Mr. Ton Drump and win the game!

'Good luck, ally,' Dr. Gucnew says with a determined look. 'This is a mission of restoration, not retribution. May your logic be sound, your sources peer-reviewed, and may you prove that civility is not, in fact, a weakness.'
